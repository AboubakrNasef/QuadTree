# Exploring QuadTrees with the Visitor Pattern
Welcome to my exploration of QuadTrees, a hierarchical data structure for spatial data storage, within the context of the Visitor Pattern.

## Introduction
In my recent journey through QuadTrees, I found the need to visualize their organizational structure for deeper insights. Leveraging the versatility of the Visitor Pattern, I separated the traversal algorithm from the operations on its elements.

## Features
Real-time Highlighting
Highlight points within specific boundaries while moving the mouse.
Dynamic Visualization
Visualize the tree's subdivision as new points are added.
## Demo
Check out the live demo here, where you can experience these features firsthand.
